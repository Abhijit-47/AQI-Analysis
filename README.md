## ðŸ“Œ Overview
![Landing Page](screenshots/landing_page.png)
This project analyzes India's Air Quality Index (AQI) trends and their connection to health, economy, and EV adoption.  
Using multiple datasets, the dashboard provides insights into:
- National & city-level AQI patterns
- Seasonal and annual trends
- Health impacts by region and age group
- EV adoption trends in high and low AQI states
- Market opportunities for air purifiers

The goal is to turn complex environmental data into actionable insights that can guide policy makers, businesses, and the public.
